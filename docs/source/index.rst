Deep Learning I/O Benchmark
===============================================================
Deep Learning I/O (`DLIO`) Benchmark is a benchmark suite aiming at emulating the I/O pattern and behavior of deep learning applications. The benchmark is delivered as an executable that can be configured for various deep learning workloads. It uses a modular design to incorporate different data loaders, data formats, dataset organizations, and use training configuration parameters similar to the actual deep learning applications. It is able to represent the I/O process of a broad spectrum of deep leanrning applications. 

The main features of `DLIO` include: 
   * Easy-to-use configuration through YAML files which represent the I/O process of different deep learing applications.
   * Easy-to-use data generator capable to generate synthetic datasets of different formats, different data organizations and layouts. 
   * Full transparency over emulation of I/O access with logging and profiling at different levels with DLIO profiler.
   * Supporting emulating both sequential training and distributed data parallel training.
