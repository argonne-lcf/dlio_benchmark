Profiling 
==========================
We have a built in support for iostat and DLIO profiler for I/O profiling. Below are instructions on how to use the two profiling tools in `DLIO`. 

iostat profiling
---------------------
To enable iostat profiling, one can set ``workload.workflow.profiling=True`` and ``workload.profiling.profiler=iostat``, and set the devices list such as '[sda, sdb]'. This will generate iostat.json file in the output folder. One can then post process the output and get out bandwidth information for the run. 

.. code-block:: bash 

    dlio_postprocessor --output-folder hydra_log/unet3d/2022-11-09-17-55-44/

The output is

DLIO profiler
--------------------------

ttps://github.com/hariharan-devarajan/dlio-profiler. A profiler developed for capturing I/O calls. If DLIO profiler is enabled, profiling trace will be generated at the end of the run. The profiler provides profiling information at both application levels and system I/O calls level. 

To enable this functionality, one has to install DLIO profiler throught 

.. code-block:: bash 

    pip install dlio-profiler


or 

.. code-block:: bash 

    git clone git@github.com:hariharan-devarajan/dlio-profiler.git
    cd dlio-profiler
    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install

Then set ```DLIO_PROFILER_ENABLE=1``` to enable it. Other environemnt variables setting can be found here: https://dlio-profiler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#configurations-of-dlio-profiler. 

The profiler outputs all profiling output in <OUTPUT_FOLDER>/.trace*.pfw files.
It contains application level profiling as well as low-level I/O calls from POSIX and STDIO layers.
The low-level I/O events are only way to understand I/O pattern from internal framework functions such as TFRecordDataset or DaliDataLoader. These files are in chrome tracing's json line format. This can be visualized using https://ui.perfetto.dev/
