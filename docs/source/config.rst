DLIO Configuration
==============================================
The characteristics of a workload is specified through a YAML file. This file will then be read by `DLIO` to setup the benchmark. Below is an example of such a YAML file. 

.. code-block:: yaml
  
  model: unet3d
    model_size_bytes: 99153191


  framework: pytorch

  workflow:
    generate_data: False
    train: True
    checkpoint: True

  dataset: 
    data_folder: data/unet3d/
    format: npz
    num_files_train: 168
    num_samples_per_file: 1
    record_length_bytes: 146600628
    record_length_bytes_stdev: 68341808
    record_length_bytes_resize: 2097152
    
  reader: 
    data_loader: pytorch
    batch_size: 4
    read_threads: 4
    file_shuffle: seed
    sample_shuffle: seed

  train:
    epochs: 5
    computation_time: 1.3604

  checkpoint:
    checkpoint_folder: checkpoints/unet3d
    checkpoint_after_epoch: 5
    epochs_between_checkpoints: 2


A `DLIO` YAML configuration file contains following sections: 

* **model** - specifying the name of the model. This is simply an indentifyer of the configuration file. It does not have impact on the actual simulation. 
* **framework** - specifying the framework to use for the benchmark, available options: tensorflow, pytorch
* **workflow** - specifying what workflow operations to execute in the pipeline. Workflow operations include: dataset generation (``generate_data``), training (``train``), evaluation (``evaluation``), checkpointing (``checkpoint``), debugging (``debug``), etc. 
* **dataset** - specifying all the information related to the dataset. 
* **reader** - specifying the configuration for data loading, such as data_loader, number of workers, etc. 
* **train** - specifying the setup for training
* **evaluation** - specifying the setup for evaluation. 
* **checkpoint** - specifying the setup for checkpointing. 
* **profiling** - specifying the setup for profiling

More built-in examples can be found in the `workload`_ folder. One can also create custom configuration file. How to load custom configuration file can be found in :ref:`run`.

     - default
     - The name of the model
   * - type
     - default
     - A string that specifies the type of the model, such as transformer, CNN, etc.
   * - model_size_bytes
     - 10240
     - The size of the model parameters per GPU in bytes
   * - model_datatype

     - the datatype of the model parameters. Available options are fp16, fp32, int8, uint8, bf16. 
   * - optimizer_datatype
     - fp32
     - the datatype of the optimizer parameters. Available options are fp16, fp32, int8, uint8, bf16.

     - []
     - List of optimization group tensors. Use Array notation for yaml.
   * - num_layers
     - -1
     - Number of layers to checkpoint. Each layer would be checkpointed separately.
   * - layer_parameters
     - []
     - List of parameters per layer. This is used to perform I/O per layer. 
   * - parallelism
     - {tensor: 1, pipeline: 1, zero_stage: 0}
     - Parallelism configuration for the model. 
   * - transformer
     - {hidden_size: 2048, ffn_hidden_size: 8196, vocab_size: 32000, num_attention_heads: 32, num_kv_heads: 8}
     - Transformer layer configuration for the model.

The model information is used to determine the checkpoint files. 
The user can specify the model architecture using either optimizaton_groups & layer_parameters, or by specifying the transformer configuration. 

The ``optimization_groups`` is a list of tensors that are grouped together for optimization. Suppose optimization_groups is specified as [1024, 528], 
each rank will write the following tensors to the checkpoint file: {"0": {"a": array of 1024, "b": array of 1024}, "1": {"a": array of 528, "b": array of 528}}. The total size of the tensor will be 1024*2 + 528*2. The ``layer_parameters`` is a list of parameters per layer. The ``num_layers`` is used to specify the number of layers to checkpoint. Each layer would be checkpointed separately. 
Suppose layer_parameters is [1024, 2048], each rank in the tensor parallelism group will write the following tensors to the checkpoint file: 
{'0': array of 1024/TP, "1": array of (2048/TP)}. Please notice the difference in how the optimization groups and layer parameters are treated internally.

We do not suggest the users to specify the model architeure in this way. Instead, we suggest the users to specify the transformer configuration directly which is more intuitive. 
The ``transformer`` configuration is used to specify the hidden size, FFN hidden size, vocab size, number of attention heads and number of kv heads for the transformer layer, which together determined the 
optimization_groups and layer_parameters. 

.. attention::

  Please note that if optimization_groups and layer_parameters are specified, the transformer configuration will be ignored. But we 
  always suggest to specify the transformer configuration for better readability.

  Please also note that ZeRO stage 3 is not compatiable with ``parallelism.pipeline > 1``.

framework
-------------------
Specify the frameork (tensorflow or pytorch) as 

.. code-block:: yaml

  framework: tensorflow

No parameters under this group. 


workflow
------------------
.. list-table:: 
   :widths: 15 10 30
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Default
     - Description
   * - generate_data
     - False
     - whether to generate dataset
   * - train
     - True
     - whether to perform training
   * - evaluation
     - False
     - whether to perform evaluation
   * - checkpoint
     - False
     - whether to perform checkpointing
   * - profiling
     - False
     - whether to perform profiling

.. note:: 

 ``evaluation``, ``checkpoint``, and ``profiling`` have depency on ``train``. If ``train`` is set to be ```False```, ``evaluation``, ``checkpoint``, ``profiling`` will be reset to ```False``` automatically. 

  Even though ``generate_data`` and ``train`` can be performed together in one job, we suggest to perform them seperately to eliminate potential caching effect. One can generate the data first by running DLIO with ```generate_data=True``` and ```train=False```, and then run training benchmark with ```generate_data=False``` and ```train=True```.

.. note:: 

  The training and validation datasets will be put in ```${data_folder}/train``` and ```${data_folder}/valid``` respectively. If ``num_subfolders_train`` and ``num_subfolders_eval`` are larger than one, the datasets will be split into multiple subfolders within ```${data_folder}/train``` and ```${data_folder}/valid``` in a round robin manner. 

.. note:: 

  If ``format`` is set to be ``synthetic``, samples will be generated in memory and fed through the data loader specified. 

.. attention::
  
  For `format: jpeg`, it is not recommended to generate data due to its lossy compression nature. Instead, provide the path to original dataset in the `data_folder` parameter. 

  More information on JPEG image generator analysis is provided at :ref:`jpeg_generator_issue` section. 
  Follow the original dataset directory structure as described in :ref:`directory structure <directory-structure-label>`

   * - preprocess_time_stdev
     - 0.0
     - The standard deviation of the amount of emulated preprocess time (sleep) in second. 
.. note:: 

  TensorFlow and PyTorch behave differently for some parameters. For ``read_threads``, tensorflow does 
  not support ``read_threads=0``, but pytorch does, in which case, the main thread will be doing data loader and no overlap between I/O and compute. 

  For pytorch, if ``prefetch_size`` is set to be 0, it will be changed to 2. In other words, the default value for ``prefetch_size`` in pytorch is 2. 

  In order to be consistent, we set ``prefetch_size`` to be 2 all the time for both pytorch and tensorflow. 

.. note:: 
  For``synthetic`` data loader, dataset will be generated in memory directly rather than loading from the storage. 

.. note:: 

  We also supoprt custom data reader and data loader. The detailed instruction on how to create custom data loader and data reader are provided here: :ref:`custom_data_loader` and :ref:`custom_data_reader`. 

train
------------------
.. list-table:: 
   :widths: 15 10 30
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Default
     - Description
   * - epochs
     - 1
     - number of epochs to simulate
   * - computation_time
     - 0.0
     - | emulated computation time per step in second
       | Can be specified as a distribution, see :ref:`Time Configuration` for more details.

     - whether to change random seed after each epoch
   * - seed

     - the random seed     

.. note:: 

  To get the simulated computation time, one has to run the actual workload and get out the timing information. 

  In actual distributed training, the communication overhead will increase the time per time step. In DLIO however, we do not simulate communication. Therefore, one can in principle include the communication time as part of `computation_time`. 


evaluation
------------------
.. list-table:: 
   :widths: 15 10 30
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Default
     - Description
   * - eval_time
     - 0
     - | emulated computation time (sleep) for each evaluation step. 
       | Can be specified as a distribution, see :ref:`Time Configuration` for more details.

     - Description
   * - checkpoint_folder
     - ./checkpoints/
     - the folder to save the checkpoints
   * - checkpoing_after_epoch
     - 1
     - start checkpointing after certain number of epochs specified 
   * - epochs_between_checkpoints

     - How many checkpoints to write; this parameter is used only when workflow.train=False
   * - recovery_after_steps:

   * - recovery_rank_shift:
*    - 0
*    - Shift the rank ID by recovery_rank_shift to avoid caching effort. The default value is 0. The suggested value would be ppn (number of processes per node). 

.. note::
   
   By default, if checkpoint is enabled, it will perform checkpointing from every epoch. One can perform multiple checkpoints within a single epoch, 
   by setting ``steps_between_checkpoints``. If ``steps_between_checkpoints`` is set to be a positive number, ``epochs_between_checkpoints`` will be ignored.

   One can also perform checkpoint only benchmark, and do not do training, i.e., do no load dataset. To do this, one can set ``workflow.train = False``, and then set ``num_checkpoints``, ``time_between_checkpoints``, ``recovery_after_steps``, and ``recovery_rank_shift``. These four
   is effective only in checkpoint only mode.

    * ``dftracer``: https://github.com/hariharan-devarajan/dftracer. DFTRACER_ENABLE=1 has to be set to enable profiler.
    Please refer to :ref:`profiling` on how to enable these profiling tools. 

Time Configuration
============================================

The time configuration is crucial for the emulation. Here, we are able to specify distribution of the time configuration.

For example, to specify distribution of the computation time, one can specify the configuration as ``dictionary`` with the following format:


* Normal Distribution

.. code-block:: yaml
   computation_time:
      mean: 1.0
      stdev: 0.1
      type: normal

   # or

   computation_time:
      mean: 1.0

   # or

   computation_time:
      mean: 1.0
      stdev: 0.1

* Uniform Distribution

.. code-block:: yaml
   computation_time:
      min: 0.5
      max: 1.5
      type: uniform

* Gamma Distribution

.. code-block:: yaml
   computation_time:
      shape: 1.0
      scale: 1.0
      type: gamma

* Exponential Distribution

.. code-block:: yaml
   computation_time:
      scale: 1.0
      type: exponential

* Poisson Distribution

.. code-block:: yaml
   computation_time:
      lam: 1.0
      type: poisson

How to create a DLIO configuration YAML file
=============================================
Creating a YAML file for a workload is very straight forward. Most of the options are essentially the same with the actual workload, such as ``framework``, ``reader``, and many options in ``train``, ``evaluation``, such as ``epochs``. The main work involved is to find out the dataset information and the computation time. For the former, one can to check the original dataset to find out the number of files for training, how many samples per file, and the sample size, data format, etc. For the latter, one has to run the actual workload to find out the comptuation time per training step. One might have to add timing stamp before and after the training step. 

The YAML files are stored in the `workload`_ folder.
It then can be loaded by ```dlio_benchmark``` through hydra (https://hydra.cc/). This will override the default settings. One can override the configurations through command line (https://hydra.cc/docs/advanced/override_grammar/basic/).
