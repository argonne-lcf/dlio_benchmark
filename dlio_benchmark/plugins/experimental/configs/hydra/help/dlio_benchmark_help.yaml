  DLIO - an IO benchmark for deep learning applications. 

  Running the benchmark: dlio_benchmark workload=unet3d

  One can select the workload configuration using "workload={WORKLOAD}". 
  The corresponding YAML file is ./configs/workload/{WORKLOAD}.yaml folder. 
  Available choise for $APP_CONFIG_GROUPS
  One can override everything in the command line, for example:
  dlio_benchmark workload.framework=tensorflow

  One can also create a custom YAML file for a specific workload. 
  An example of a YAML file is as follows. 

  -------
  $CONFIG
  -------
  A complete list of config options in the YAML file can be found: 
  https://argonne-lcf.github.io/dlio_benchmark/config.html

  By default all the output files will be saved in hydra.run.dir. 
  This can be changed in ./configs/config.yaml.
